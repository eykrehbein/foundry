description: 'Learn what Foundry is and how to use it in your LLM apps.'

Foundry is a framework-agnostic toolset to create and use Functions in LLM apps.

When you create **Functions** with Foundry, they are organized in `class`es called **Tools**. For example, the `Calculator` Tool contains a `calculate` Function that can be used to perform calculations by passing in a math string.

Tools and Functions can easily be passed to LLMs like OpenAI's GPT-4 without writing custom JSON Schema definitions. The way they are defined allow for a generation of the JSON Schema on the fly by inferring the required arguments, names and descriptions.

[_Btw, we'd love to welcome you as a contributor to Foundry!_](./contributing)

## When to use Foundry?

-   Whenever you want to integrate Functions into your LLM apps without the need to write custom JSON Schema definitions.
-   You want to build LLM applications that have broad capabilities and can be used for a variety of tasks.

## Why use Foundry?

-   **Community effort**: We want to build a great community of developers that are passionate about building LLM apps. Tools are written by developers, for developers.
-   **Easy to use**: Foundry is designed to be the easiest way to expose Functions to LLMs.
-   **Customizable**: You can easily add custom Tools and Functions and use them in your LLM apps.
-   **Framework-agnostic**: Foundry can be used in combination with any framework, e.g. LangChain, LlamaIndex or directly with OpenAI's SDK.
-   **Standalone functions**: Functions can be used without the need for any LLMs or the `Foundry` class. Just install the respective Tool and call the function directly.

## Examples

### Using GPT-4 as LLM

In this example, we use OpenAI's GPT-4 model to evaluate a given prompt and run the appropriate function from the Foundry tools.

Note how the `getPreparedFunctions` dynamically generates the Function definitions in the way OpenAI expects them.

After the LLM has predicted the Function to run, we can use `runSelectedFunction` to run the Function with the computed arguments to get the desired result.

```typescript openai.ts
import { Foundry } from '@usefoundry/foundry'
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai'

import WeatherApiTool from '@usefoundry/tools-api-weather-api'
import CsvTool from '@usefoundry/tools-file-csv'
import CalculatorTool from '@usefoundry/tools-utils-calculator'

// Create a foundry instance with the tools we want to use
const foundry = new Foundry({
    tools: [
        new WeatherApiTool({
            apiKey: process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY!,
        }),
        new CsvTool(),
        new CalculatorTool(),
    ],
})

// Initialize OpenAI API
const configuration = new Configuration({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
})
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration)

const runPrompt = async ({ userPrompt }: { userPrompt: string }) => {
    // Set some context for the prompt
    const prompt = `
        Context:
        - Current date: ${new Date().toDateString()}
        
        Prompt:
        ${userPrompt}
    `

    //! Get all functions from the Foundry tools defined above
    // They are formatted in the way OpenAI expects them
    const functions = foundry.getPreparedFunctions({ target: 'openai' })

    // Run the prompt against the OpenAI model
    const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
        functions: functions,
        function_call: 'auto',
        messages: [
            {
                role: 'user',
                content: prompt,
            },
        ],
        model: 'gpt-4-0613',
        temperature: 0,
    })

    const targetFunctionProps = response.data.choices[0].message?.function_call

    if (!targetFunctionProps) {
        throw new Error('No function found in response')
    }

    const functionResult = foundry.runSelectedFunction(targetFunctionProps)

    return functionResult
}

await runPrompt({ userPrompt: 'What is the weather in Berlin today?' })
await runPrompt({ userPrompt: 'What is 2 + 2?' })
await runPrompt({
    userPrompt: 'Write a list of the latest 10 US presidents into ./presidents.csv',
})
await runPrompt({ userPrompt: 'Get a random number between 30 and 60' })
```

### Standalone

You can also use the functions from Foundry standalone, without LLMs or the `Foundry` class.

```typescript standalone.ts
import CsvTool from '@usefoundry/tools-file-csv'

const csv = new CsvTool()

const presidents = [
    {
        name: 'Joe Biden',
        party: 'Democratic',
    },
    {
        name: 'Donald Trump',
        party: 'Republican',
    },
    {
        name: 'Barack Obama',
        party: 'Democratic',
    },
]

await csv.writeCsvFileSync({
    data: presidents,
    path: './presidents.csv',
})
```
