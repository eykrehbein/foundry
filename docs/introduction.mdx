## What is Foundry?

Foundry is a framework-agnostic collection of tools that you can use to build dynamic LLM applications.

A tool contains a set of functions that can be used to perform a specific task within a certain domain. For example, the `Calculator` tool contains a `calculate` function that can be used to perform calculations by passing in a math string.

This tool can easily be passed to LLMs without writing custom JSON Schema. You can also just use certain functions from tools, not all.

Under the hood, it's a community-made collection of functions that are defined in a certain way so that they can easily be used by any LLM app.

## Why use Foundry?

-   **Community effort**: We want to build a great community of developers that are passionate about building LLM apps. Tools are written by developers, for developers.
-   **Easy to use**: Foundry is designed to be the easiest way to expose functions to LLMs.
-   **Customizable**: You can easily add custom tools and functions and use them in your LLM apps.
-   **Framework-agnostic**: Foundry can be used in combination with any framework, e.g. LangChain, LlamaIndex or directly with OpenAI's SDK.
-   **Standalone functions**: Functions can be used without the need for any LLMs or the `Foundry` class. Just install the respective tool call the function directly.

## Usage

The core use-case of Foundry is to enable LLM apps to use functions from various tools in order to perform complex tasks or API calls in real-time.

However, you can also use all functions standalone, without LLMs or the `Foundry` class.

### Example using GPT-4 as LLM

In this example, we use OpenAI's GPT-4 model to evaluate a given prompt and run the appropriate function from the Foundry tools.

Note how the `getPreparedFunctions` dynamically generates the function definitions in the way OpenAI expects them.

After the LLM has predicted the function to run, we can use `runSelectedFunction` to run the function with the computed arguments to get the desired result.

```typescript openai.ts
import { Foundry } from '@usefoundry/foundry'
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai'

import WeatherApiTool from '@usefoundry/tools-api-weather-api'
import CsvTool from '@usefoundry/tools-file-csv'
import CalculatorTool from '@usefoundry/tools-utils-calculator'

// Create a foundry instance with the tools we want to use
const foundry = new Foundry({
    tools: [
        new WeatherApiTool({
            apiKey: process.env.WEATHER_API_KEY!,
        }),
        new CsvTool(),
        new CalculatorTool(),
    ],
})

// Initialize OpenAI API
const configuration = new Configuration({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY!,
})
const openai = new OpenAIApi(configuration)

const runPrompt = async ({ userPrompt }: { userPrompt: string }) => {
    // Set some context for the prompt
    const prompt = `
        Context:
        - Current date: ${new Date().toDateString()}
        
        Prompt:
        ${userPrompt}
    `

    //! Get all functions from the Foundry tools defined above
    // They are formatted in the way OpenAI expects them
    const functions = foundry.getPreparedFunctions({ target: 'openai' })

    // Run the prompt against the OpenAI model
    const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
        functions: functions,
        function_call: 'auto',
        messages: [
            {
                role: 'user',
                content: prompt,
            },
        ],
        model: 'gpt-4-0613',
        temperature: 0,
    })

    const targetFunctionProps = response.data.choices[0].message?.function_call

    if (!targetFunctionProps) {
        throw new Error('No function found in response')
    }

    const functionResult = foundry.runSelectedFunction(targetFunctionProps)

    return functionResult
}

await runPrompt({ userPrompt: 'What is the weather in Berlin today?' })
await runPrompt({ userPrompt: 'What is 2 + 2?' })
await runPrompt({
    userPrompt: 'Write a list of the latest 10 US presidents into ./presidents.csv',
})
await runPrompt({ userPrompt: 'Get a random number between 30 and 60' })
```

### Standalone usage

You can also use the functions from Foundry standalone, without LLMs or the `Foundry` class.

```typescript standalone.ts
import CsvTool from '@usefoundry/tools-file-csv'

const csv = new CsvTool()

const presidents = [
    {
        name: 'Joe Biden',
        party: 'Democratic',
    },
    {
        name: 'Donald Trump',
        party: 'Republican',
    },
    {
        name: 'Barack Obama',
        party: 'Democratic',
    },
]

await csv.writeCsvFileSync({
    data: presidents,
    path: './presidents.csv',
})
```
