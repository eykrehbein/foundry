## Tools

A tool is a collection of functions that are bundled by a common purpose.
In simple terms, it's just a `class` containing `public` functions.

Every tool is it's own npm package. Find a list and documentation of all tools [here](/tools).
To use a tool, install it using a package manager like npm or yarn.

Tools are logically grouped into multiple categories:

-   `API` Tools are used to interact with a third-party API
-   `File` Tools are used to interact with local files of different formats
-   `Utils` Tools are used to perform common tasks like string manipulation, calculations, random number generation, etc.

## Functions

A function is a function within the tool class. Functions are declared with a **schema** and a **handler**.

The **schema** is a `zod` schema that describes the input of the function. When using it with Foundry, it's converted to a JSON schema which LLMs can understand.
The **handler** is a function that is called when the function is executed. It receives the input as an object and returns the output.

## Using just parts of a tool

By default, all functions of a tool are exposed to LLMs. However, you can also expose just a single function or a subset of functions using the `pickFromTool` function provided by `@usefoundry/foundry`.

## Example implementation of a Tool

To better understand how tools work, let's look at an example implementation of a tool.

This tool is a calculator that can be used to evaluate mathematical expressions.
It exposes the `calculate` function which takes an expression as input and returns the result as a string.

```typescript packages/tools/utils/calculator/src/tool.ts
import { makeFunction } from '@usefoundry/utils'
import { z } from 'zod'
import { evaluate } from 'mathjs'

export class CalculatorTool {
    constructor() {}

    public calculate = makeFunction(
        z
            .object({
                expression: z.string().describe('The mathematical expression to evaluate'),
            })
            .describe(
                'Evaluates a mathematical expression and returns the result as string. Always use it do any math'
            ),
        async ({ expression }) => {
            return evaluate(expression)
        }
    )
}

export default CalculatorTool
```
