    ## Installation

    First, install the base package.
    It contains core functionalities like:
    - Register [Tools and Functions](/essentials/tools-and-functions) that should be used
    - Parse Tools and Functions into a format the LLM can understand
    - Parse the LLM result, pick the function that should be executed and run it
